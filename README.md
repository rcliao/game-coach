## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or later
- Git
- Ravenswatch game (for testing)

### Installation

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd game-coach

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Testing Phase 1 Implementation

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Due to Windows/VS Code terminal limitations, please start the app manually instead of using background npm commands.

To test the completed Phase 1 features:

```powershell
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the development server (run this manually)
# npm run dev
```

**Manual Testing Required**:
1. **Start the app yourself**: Run `npm run dev` in your terminal
2. **Follow test procedures**: See `PHASE1_TEMPLATE_SELECTION_TEST.md` for detailed testing instructions  
3. **Verify template selection fix**: Select "Combat Focused Coach" and verify it shows "Active: Combat Focused Coach"
4. **Test all scenarios**: Template switching, status display, service initialization
5. **Report results**: Let me know what you observe for each test case

**Key Test**: The critical fix ensures that selecting "Combat Focused Coach" (ravenswatch-combat) shows the correct template name instead of "No Template Selected".

# Start the application (recommended for testing)
npm start

# For development with hot reload (if needed)
npm run dev
```

**Important**: Follow the comprehensive test plan in `PHASE_1_TEST_PLAN.md` to verify:
1. Custom Instructions System functionality
2. Overlay Testing Suite performance (5-second target)
3. End-to-end integration between custom instructions and LLM analysis

## 🔧 Architecture Overview

### Current Implementation Status
The application uses a **centralized state management architecture** with a synchronized state system between the main and renderer processes. All three phases are complete with production-ready features.

### Core Architecture Components

#### 1. **Main Process (Electron Backend)**
- **`main.ts`**: Application lifecycle, window management (main + overlay windows)
- **`state-manager.ts`**: Centralized state with automatic persistence and IPC synchronization
- **`ipc-handlers.ts`**: IPC communication handlers for screen capture, settings, etc.
- **`screen-capture.ts`**: Screen recording foundation using Electron's desktopCapturer
- **`image-processor.ts`**: Frame processing utilities using Sharp

#### 2. **Renderer Process (React Frontend)**
- **Components**: Modular UI components with clear separation of concerns
- **Services**: Business logic layers for LLM, TTS, game detection, and screen capture
- **Stores**: Synchronized state management using Zustand with IPC communication
- **Types**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for type safety

#### 3. **State Management Architecture**
```typescript
// Centralized state in main process
interface GlobalState {
  gameDetection: GameDetectionResult | null
  gameState: GameState
  isAnalyzing: boolean
  lastAnalysis: Advice | null
  settings: AppSettings
  isOverlayVisible: boolean
}

// Renderer synchronizes via IPC
const syncStore = useSyncGameCoachStore() // All components use this
```

#### 4. **IPC Communication Pattern**
- **Main → Renderer**: Automatic state broadcasts when state changes
- **Renderer → Main**: Async state updates via IPC handlers
- **State Persistence**: Automatic settings save/load to user data directory

#### 5. **Overlay System**
- **Dual Window Architecture**: Separate overlay window for transparent game overlay
- **Auto-show Logic**: Automatically appears when game detected + overlay enabled
- **Theme Support**: Dark (gaming), Light, Minimal themes with size/opacity controls

### Key Design Patterns

#### Synchronized State Management
All state mutations go through the main process to ensure consistency:
```typescript
// Renderer updates state via IPC
await stateSetGameDetection(detection)
await stateSetSettings(newSettings)

// Main process broadcasts updates to all windows
this.broadcastStateUpdate()
```

#### Service Layer Architecture
Business logic is encapsulated in services:
- **`LLMService`**: OpenAI GPT-4 Vision & Google Gemini integration
- **`TTSService`**: Gaming-optimized text-to-speech with urgency detection
- **`GameDetectorService`**: Process-based game detection
- **`GameTemplateService`**: Game-specific configurations and prompts

#### Component Composition
UI components are focused and composable:
- **`ConfigPanel`**: Main control interface with unified workflow management
- **`GameOverlay`**: Transparent overlay with advice display and theming
- **`AnalysisEngine`**: Background LLM analysis orchestrator
- **`SettingsModal`**: Comprehensive settings management
