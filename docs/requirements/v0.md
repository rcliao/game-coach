# Overlay Gaming Coach – MVP PRD

## 1. Product Overview

A lightweight desktop overlay that observes live gameplay via screen capture, streams compressed frames or structured telemetry to an LLM (ChatGPT or Gemini) in real time, and surfaces concise tactical advice to the player through an on‑screen widget or synthesized voice. Goal: validate user value and technical feasibility with ≤150 ms advice latency for one PC title.

## 2. Objectives & Success Metrics

* **Latency**: 90th‑percentile advice turnaround ≤150 ms.
* **Accuracy**: ≥70 % of tips judged correct by testers.
* **Adoption**: 80 % of invited beta users play ≥3 matches with overlay enabled.
* **Engagement**: Avg. ≥2 advice interactions per minute without reported overload.
* **Overhead**: CPU+GPU usage increase <10 %.

## 3. Target Users

Competitive PC gamers, streamers, and early tech adopters who want instant tactical coaching.

## 4. Key User Stories

1. Auto‑warn me when my HP is critical so I can retreat.
2. Suggest the optimal item when I open the shop.
3. Provide headset‑only audio tips so my stream audio stays clean.
4. After the match, show annotated replays of key moments.

## 5. MVP Scope

* Screen capture module (OBS virtual cam/Desktop Duplication API).
* 720 p/30 fps frame down‑scaler & region cropper.
* Real‑time LLM connector (ChatGPT/Gemini Live API).
* Prompt templating with HUD legend.
* Advice rate‑limiter (max one tip every 5 s).
* Overlay renderer (Electron/Tauri) with optional TTS.
* Config UI for API keys, game selection, output mode.

### Out‑of‑Scope (Post‑MVP)

* Per‑champion CV fine‑tunes, mobile & console, squad coordination, RL feedback loop, full on‑device inference.

## 6. Technical Architecture

1. **Capture Service** → grabs frames, writes to shared memory.
2. **Analyzer Service** → JPEG encode → stream to LLM; receives token stream; extracts JSON advice.
3. **Overlay Service** → draws advice bubbles / plays TTS.
4. **Control Panel** (React/Electron) → config, telemetry.
   Inter‑service Comms: WebSocket or gRPC.

## 7. Dependencies

OpenAI or Google AI keys, OBS/ffmpeg, ElevenLabs/Coqui TTS, Electron/Tauri runtime.

## 8. Assumptions

* HUD readable at 720 p.
* Anti‑cheat allows capture & overlays.
* Token budget sufficient at 30 fps cropped frames.

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk             | Impact             | Mitigation                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Latency >150 ms  | Advice stale       | Reduce resolution; delta prompts; local caching.       |
| Incorrect advice | Player frustration | Confidence threshold & human eval loop.                |
| High API cost    | Unsustainable      | Frame batching; token budget tuning; research credits. |
| TOS violations   | Account bans       | Use spectator APIs or second‑device display.           |

## 10. Open Questions

1. Which **game(s)** should we support first? (e.g., League of Legends, Rocket League)
2. Preferred **delivery mode**: overlay, audio‑only, or both?
3. Acceptable **latency ceiling** and **API cost** per hour?
4. Required **privacy/data retention** policy?
5. Need for a **mobile companion app** for off‑screen tips?
