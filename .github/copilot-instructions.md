# General Workflow Instructions for Copilot

Please do not attemp to run `npm run dev` or `npm run start` since I am on Windows and VS code terminal (especiall background jobs) can fail to run the start command. Instead, create unit test or write test instructions for me to test and verify. If there is specific log output that will be useful to grab, let me know so I can copy and paste the test output back for iteration.

Please read README.md (and update if necessary) to understand the project structure and how to run the tests.
